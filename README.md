A single Jupyter notebook (`Kim_Emmanuel_project_3.ipynb`) that implements all required tasks in the Python 1 assignment.

## Notebook sections
| # | Topic | Goal |
|---|-------|------|
| 0 | Data types & copying | List mutable/immutable objects; explain assignment vs. shallow vs. deep copy |
| 1 | String extraction | Use `find`/`rfind`, slice the number, convert to `float` |
| 2 | Conditionals | Translate MATLAB `switch` to Python `if‑elif‑else` |
| 3 | Factorial (while) | Compute `n!` for a positive integer |
| 4 | Prime test | `is_prime(n)` – efficient trial division |
| 5 | Prime factors | `prime_factors(n)` using list comprehensions |
| 6 | Pascal’s triangle (recursion) | `pascal(n)` returns the *n*‑th row |
| 7 | Pascal’s triangle (loops) | `pascal_by_loops(n)` – same result, no recursion |
| 8 | Good practice | Style notes, Git commit guidelines |

Each cell contains sample input/output for quick verification.
